# Changelog

Operator-facing changes to the Server and the Client — what a running deployment
has to be told about, in particular anything that must be edited or moved before
an upgrade. The reasoning behind each change lives in the ADR it names
([`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/)); this file says only what to do.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). A
version is the one `[workspace.package] version` in `Cargo.toml` names, which
the release pipeline creates the `version/*` tag from
([ADR-0012](docs/adr/0012-versions-resolved-in-the-internal-crate.md)). A
section carries a date once its tag exists.

## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- **The Server's audit record.** The Server no longer writes the hash-chained
  record under `<data_dir>/audit`; every security decision is now one
  structured event on its log output, standard error
  ([ADR-0022](docs/adr/0022-security-decisions-are-structured-log-events.md)).
  Keep the log with whatever runs the Server; the refusals a peer can repeat
  at will are logged at `debug`, shown with `RUST_LOG=info,fleet_server=debug`.
- **`[audit]` in `server.toml`** is refused at startup as an unknown key, like
  any other.
- **`server audit-verify`** is gone.
