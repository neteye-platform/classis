# Changelog

Operator-facing changes to the Server and the Client — what a running deployment
has to be told about, in particular anything that must be edited or moved before
an upgrade. The reasoning behind each change lives in the ADR it names
([`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/)); this file says only what to do.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). A
version is the one `[workspace.package] version` in `Cargo.toml` names, which
the release pipeline creates the `version/*` tag from
([ADR-0012](docs/adr/0012-versions-resolved-in-the-internal-crate.md)). A
section carries a date once its tag exists.
